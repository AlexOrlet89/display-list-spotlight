Pick a domain (thing you want to maek a list out of) and make your js be named it e.g. animals .js
in julie's example she is declaring an array called animals which she will export...

```
export const animals = [
  {
    type: 'dog',
    numberOfLegs: 4,
    class: 'mammals',
    cuteness: 10,
    image: 'icons8-dog-100.png',
  },
]
```
she then adds 3 more animals and finds icons online.
